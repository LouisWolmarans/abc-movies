Project Outline
Please create a simple web application that allows users to:
* Allow you to search for movies and add movies to a "watch later" list. 
* Users should be able to search for a movie by entering text. 
* These results should be displayed to the user with sufficient information for them to choose to add it to their "watch later" list. 
* Users should also be able to view their "watch later" list and remove items from the list. 
* Selecting an item should show more details about the movie.
* The "watch later" list should be persisted somewhere like a database.
* A user will login so that the "watch later" list can be stored against their user, so that if a different user logs in, they won't see the same list.

API details:
* You will be using an API from The Movie DB (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)
* API Key: xxxxxxxx
* Example get popular:
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=xxxxxxxx
* Example search: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=xxxxxxxx&query=home%20alone 
* Example get details: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/12536?api_key=xxxxxxxx

The choice of technology is up to you:
Ideally, this project shouldn't take you too long. It isn't about creating a project that you would be happy to put into production, but more to give us the best idea of how you write code and approach a problem. There is no right or wrong answer here, this is just an opportunity for you to show us how you think and code. 

Please make note of any compromises and assumptions you have made. You can share the code however you see fit, using something like Github might be best, but I'll leave that to you.
